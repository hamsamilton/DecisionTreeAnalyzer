# Tree Analyzer

RPart provides powerful software for visualizing decision trees. Unfortunately, it is only compatible with the somewhat complex RPart object, which can be difficult to understand and create. This presents a problem for those of us who would like to visualize decision trees created either by hand or with other software.

Tree Analyzer serves as an adapter for RPart, allowing users to supply a decision tree in the user-friendly format used by the randomForest package. Although it does not currently support some of the additional information that can be generated by `rpart.plot`, it generally works as expected.

## Status

This software is currently in beta and needs additional bug testing.

## Future Work

Future iterations may include additional functions for decision tree analysis. While there are some additional functions included to further analyze decision trees, these are currently a work in progress.

## Usage

The main function is `adapt_rf2rpart`. Call this function on your randomForest style tree object, and it will transform it into an rpart object compatible with `rpart.plot`.

By default, the tree is populated with fake sample data. However, by setting `add_data = T` and supplying an X and y input, you can provide training data to observe how your data traverses the tree.
